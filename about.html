                <h4>I have no idea why you are here or you even care about this. But now you are here so I will tell you that, I know multiverse algorithms and no one in this universe knows about this. Pandas are my favourite creatures they are fat, chubby and too f**ing lonely in every universe I had looked, they seemed very sad and alone, it broke my heart So i created this thing called galacticverse in which I had put 5000 pandas from parallel universes. Next step was to find those creatures who can take care of these pandas like their own children. Then I came across a very vibrant planet from 10,000 light years far. It had ecosystem unlike any other world I witnessed some signals like  "我们会杀死所有的熊猫" I have no  idea what it meant but some source had told me that these creatures are taking care of pandas unlike I had ever heard. Then I converted them into metaphysical animals. It gave them unimaginable characteristics and intelligence beyond any real world's creatures. Then I uploaded each one of them on web3. They only exits in web space but they are alive stuck in polygon space, they really need a host. Do not worry, they are not harmed in any way but just their feelings and their intelligence have become digital algorithms and they have lost a real body. This is the only solution to this decomposing reality. My friend Xiolong have translated my message to the language you creatures speak.</h4>

                <h2>WHY I DID IT</h2>
                <h4>We have evolved enough to surpass the boundaries of this reality. Now we no longer have to suffer and die because our reality drives us to do so. We can live completely inside web. Simulation theory is no longer just a theory. Our consciousness can be turned into numbers. We no longer need cells that die after some time, organs that stop working and body that becomes harder and harder to handle with age. It will take a lot of time to convert everyone into metaphysical things so at first I am only focusing on pandas which are my favourite creatures. I will continue my operation slowly. </h4>
